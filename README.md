# Rock-paper-scissors

Hello, there!<br><br>
<h2> Project desciption </h2>
This is a simple game of rock paper scissors made using HTML, CSS and JavaScipt. 
It takes in user input in the form of one of the three choices - Rock, Paper and Scissors. 
Based on the comparison between the user input and the computer choice, the result is declared. When the user's and computer's choices tie, the clicked
icon's border is illuminated with a grey shadow. Similarly, when the user wins a round, the border gets illuminated with the colour green and red, when
the user loses. A score board keeps the record of scores of both the user and the computer. Every time the user wins, the user score goes up by one and 
similarly for the computer. <br><br>
